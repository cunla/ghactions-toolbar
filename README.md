<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin creates a tool-window on JetBrains products (IntelliJ, PyCharm, ...) where you can view GitHub workflow runs
of the repository. This plugin is a good alternative to alt-tabbing for every time you push some changes to the branch
and want to see whether the repository's checks are passing on your changes.

You can support the development of the plugin and get a few extra features by purchasing the plugin on the JetBrains for
$2 a month.
